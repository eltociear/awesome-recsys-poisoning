## Poison Attacks
### Overview
Poisoning attacks are the process of tampering with the training data of a  machine learning (ML) model in order to corrupt its availability and integrity. Below figure presents the typical process of a poisoning attack  compared to the normal learning process. In the latter case, an ML  model is trained based on data, which is subsequently used to derive a 
recommendation. As such, the quality of the ML model depends on the quality of the data used for training. In a poisoning attack, data is injected into the training process, and hence the model, to produce unintended or harmful conclusions.

### Model-agnostic
A first class of poisoning attacks has been designed to test the general robustness of a recommender
system in terms of its trustworthiness. As such, these attacks are designed to be independent of any specific prediction model, or a specific class of such models. In the remainder of this section, we review prominent examples of such model-agnostic attacks.
